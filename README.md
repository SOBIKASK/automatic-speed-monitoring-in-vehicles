 # Project description :

#This project is about monitoring the vehicles in the tollgate. We made more progress to monitor if the vehicle was crossing the speed limit or not .

#When the speed is more than the limit the notification will be sent to the person by registered phone number, or e-mail. 

# Abstract:

  Over speed is one of the foremost motives for growth within the occurrence of injuries in recent times.Many techniques are being used for over speed  monitoring. But, these strategies require a lot of manpower.
In this project , we give the design and implementation of a gadget, which offers an easy manner to the traffic government for tracking all the automobiles from the control room itself.
This system calculates the rate and GPS coordinates continuously and these GPS coordinates assist to find out the location wherein the vehicle has been present and the most speed allowed in the respective region. 
The speed and the coordinates of the car are continuously stored in a reminiscence card. If the velocity of any automobile exceeds the speed restrict, the driving force is alerted through a buzzer indicating the equal. 
If the driving force nonetheless does no longer force the speed restriction, an SMS, which contains the vehicle registration number, GPS coordinates at which he exceeded the velocity limit, is dispatched to site visitors authorities. 
Hence an over speed price tag can be issued towards the identical car.
